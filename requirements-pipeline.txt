# Core ML/CV dependencies
opencv-python
numpy
Pillow
omegaconf  # Required for loading some PyTorch model checkpoints

# Deep Learning
ultralytics

# NVIDIA TAO dependencies (optional - for loading TAO-trained models)
# Note: If nvidia-tao-core is not available, model loading will still work
# with weights_only=False if you trust the checkpoint source
# WARNING: nvidia-tao-core is a HUGE package that takes hours to install
# Only uncomment if you absolutely need it for .pth models
# For TensorRT .engine models, this is NOT needed
# nvidia-tao-core

# ReID Pipeline dependencies
redis
psycopg2-binary
